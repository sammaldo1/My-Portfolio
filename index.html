    About Me

  </h2>
  <p class="AboutMeContent">

    I love everything about the tech world, from "Hello World" to creating web pages (remember Myspace? That's where I
    started!).
    <br>After studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Object Methods, and so much more, I've become even more passionate!
    <br>
    I self-learn React and take coding boot camps to stay familiar with current processes. There is so much to learn and
    so much that can be done.
