    About Me

  </h2>
  <p class="AboutMeContent">

    I love everything about the tech world, from "Hello World" to creating webpages (remember Myspace? That's where I
    started!).
    <br>After
    studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Object Methods, and so much more, I've become even more passionate!
    <br>
    From self learning more on React, taking coding bootcamps to stay familiar. There is so much to learn and so much
    that can be done.
